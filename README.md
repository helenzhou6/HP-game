# Whack-a-mole! ðŸ•³

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/helenzhou6/Whack-a-Mole.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/helenzhou6/Whack-a-Mole)

A game made in React ~ whack-a-mole! Try it out [here](https://whack-a-moleeee.netlify.com/).

Originally was a two-day project to learn React through paired programming (view original repo [here](https://github.com/fac-13/HP-game/tree/master/src/components)), that I then forked and worked on independently.
